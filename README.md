## A Multi-Model Deep Learning Architecture for Diagnosing Multi-Class Skin Diseases
<p align="justify">
Skin diseases pose a significant global public health concern, affecting 21–85% of the world’s population (1.26–5.1 billion people) residing in low- and middle-income countries. The accurate and timely diagnosis of skin conditions is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. In this work, we proposed a multi-model deep learning architecture for classifying the skin lesion images into one of five categories: Atopic Dermatitis, Acne and Rosacea, Skin Cancer, Bullous, and Others. The first step of the proposed system is image pre-processing, which performs image filtering and transformation techniques to remove any noise and increase the dataset size. The filtered images are fed into the five-category Xception model trained to classify the skin lesion images into one of the five mentioned skin disease categories. The trained weights of the five-category Xception model are utilized in the next stage of the multi-model architecture and used in the four transfer learning models implemented separately for each category to achieve high accuracy and reliability results.
